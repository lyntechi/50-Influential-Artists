                <div class="bio">Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen); 30 March 1853 – 29
                    July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential
                    figures
                    in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including
                    around
                    860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still
                    lifes,
                    portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and
                    expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. However, he was not
                    commercially
                    successful, and his suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.</div>

                    Turner
                    and contemporarily as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and water
                    colourist.
                    He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent

                <div class="bio">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content
                    of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                    normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look
                    like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
                    their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
                    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
                    (injected humour and the like).

                    galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
                    centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
                    popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
                    more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
                    Ipsum.
